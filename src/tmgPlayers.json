    "PlayerDescription": "Regarded by most in Uruguay to be the top central defender in youth football in the country. \nPhysically strong and brave winning most aerial battles. Very high technical level with high level of distribution to the front and midfield. Reads the game very well which means he arrives before others to stop the danger. A very intelligent player who is captain of the category a year young and has also played some friendly games already with the first team. Potential be a top player."
